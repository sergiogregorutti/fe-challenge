# Take Home Instructions

## Introduction
This project requires you to create a layout as shown in the provided [Sketch Design](https://www.sketch.com/s/547dbe8d-e0d7-4c52-b027-1d05fe2277a2/a/Mm2bAPW). The layout includes:
- A **left-hand side** displaying a list of musical bands fetched dynamically from a JSON file.
- A **search bar** for filtering bands by name.
- A **set of filters** they don't need to be functional just styled
- A **right-hand side** with static placeholder text ("copy").

## Folder Structure

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing detailed instructions.
- **`sources/`**: containing all of the assets needed
- **`mock_data/`**
  - `bands.json`: Contains band details for populating the list.
  - `[id]/.json`: Contains details about each individual band

## Tasks to Complete

1. **Understand the Layout**
   - Open the [Sketch Design](https://www.sketch.com/s/547dbe8d-e0d7-4c52-b027-1d05fe2277a2/a/Mm2bAPW).
   - Study the layout structure:
     - Left-hand side: Band list from `bands.json`.
     - Top: Search bar to filter bands.
     - Top: filters, don't need to be functional
     - Right-hand side: Static copy text.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Use any preferred tools (e.g., React, next, vue, plain JavaScript).
   - Prepare a local server if needed to serve the JSON file.

3. **Fetch and Display Data**
   - Fetch `bands.json` from the `mock_data/` folder.
   - Populate the list dynamically on the left-hand side that includes band name and album.
   - Match each band's ***id*** with an image file in the sources/ folder:
     - For example, if the id is 001, use im001.png from the sources/ folder
     - If the image does not exist, use default.png as a fallback
   - fetch information from each individual band from the other json files, fallback to a default text if no json for the artist

4. **Implement the Search Bar and Filter Functionality**
   - Add a search bar above the band list.
   - Filter displayed bands in real-time as the user types.
   - Add a set of filters next to the search bar to filter bands by genre
   - When a genre filter is clicked, display only the bands matching that genre.
   - Ensure the filters and the search functionality work together (e.g., applying both a genre filter and search query simultaneously).

5. **Add Icons**   
   - Use any icon library (e.b. Font Awesome, React-Icons) to replicate the icons at the top. The icons do not need to match teh design exactly but should be similar in style, they needn't be functional.

6. **Add Static Copy**
   - On the right-hand side, include static placeholder text (e.g., “This is placeholder copy”).

7. **Stretch Goal**
   - Implement functionality to close the right-hand side content and expand the left hand side.

8. **Style the Layout**
   - Use `layout_sketch.png` as a reference for styling.
   - Ensure responsiveness.

9. **Test Your Implementation**
   - Verify the list loads correctly and filters as expected.
   - Confirm the layout matches the design.

10. **Submit Your Work**
   - Zip your solution with:
     - All source code.
     - A short README for setup instructions.
   - You have 24 hours from the moment you receive to finish.
